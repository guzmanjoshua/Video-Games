# Creating A Game In A Week

I created the game Necromancer's Deed for a Game Jam. A Game Jam is a free online community event where multipe people can join and create there own games. A Game Jam typically has a theme and a time limit on how long you have to create and submit your game. The Game Jam I joined when I made this game was [Brackeys Game Jam 2021.1](https://itch.io/jam/brackeys-5). The theme was 'Stronger Together' and the time limit was 1 week.

I designed and implemented all code, art, gameplay, and level design. I collaborated with my friend for the music and sourced the sound effects. I used the Unity Game Engine which uses C# for the code, and used Visual Studio 2019 to write the code.

Play the game for free, using the link below.
